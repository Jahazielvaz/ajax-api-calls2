THINGS TO INTERNALIZE
-XMLHttpRequest: All web browsers have a built in tool named XMLHttpRequest
  This tool allows us to establish a connection with the target url, and allows us to send and receive data.
  This tool allows us to make api calls to other websites
- .open(): This is the method that actually takes in your command as to what you want to do with the XMLHttpRequest() method. This method takes 2 arguments. The first one is whether we want to send or receive data. Here you specify what kind of request it is. You can make crud requests here.
  The second argument is the url that you want to talk to.
- .onload(): In this method we specify what should happen once the data is loaded.
- responseText: This is how you actually access the JSON data that you retrieved from the api. It's kind of the equivalent of req.body
- .send(): In order for the request to actually go through, you need to send the request with the .send() method

NEW CONCEPTS
- insertAdjacentHTML(): I'm not fully sure how this method works, but I think it's another way of generating HTML elements on the fly. I believe the first parameter specifies where you want the new html element/s to show, and the second parameter is the html we want to add. From what I can see, this method really only messes with the inner text of the html. I need to research it a bit more.
- Apparently if you're trying to increment a number stored in a variable, it only persists if the original variable is outside of the function. I think the reason is because when you create the variable inside of the function, the function is creating it every time, whereas if it's outside of the function, it is permanently created, and therefore persistent

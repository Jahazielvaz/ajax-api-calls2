THINGS TO INTERNALIZE
-XMLHttpRequest: All web browsers have a built in tool named XMLHttpRequest
  This tool allows us to establish a connection with the target url, and allows us to send and receive data.
  This tool allows us to make api calls to other websites
- .open(): This is the method that actually takes in your command as to what you want to do with the XMLHttpRequest() method. This method takes 2 arguments. The first one is whether we want to send or receive data. Here you specify what kind of request it is. You can make crud requests here.
  The second argument is the url that you want to talk to.
- .onload(): In this method we specify what should happen once the data is loaded.
- responseText: This is how you actually access the JSON data that you retrieved from the api. It's kind of the equivalent of req.body
- .send(): In order for the request to actually go through, you need to send the request with the .send() method
